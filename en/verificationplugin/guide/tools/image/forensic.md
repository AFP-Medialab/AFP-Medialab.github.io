## General information

**Image forensic** analysis aims to detect anomalies and possible forgeries in the image signal. This is a complex tool which involves a mathematical analysis of the signal to detect traces in the image compression, incoherences in frequencies, in pixel distribution, in residual noise. 
Those traces are not only caused by forgeries. They can also be triggered by demosaicing (the way cameras interpolate pixels to build digital images), by overexposure (too much light in some parts of the image) or by object complex or satured texture such as black or white zones, lattice areas.
Therefore, forensic analysis should be used with caution. More filters outline some particular zone, more likely the image has undergone a manipulation.
Nevertheless, this is a powerful tool to reveal forgeries, especially if the original image cannot be retrieved through similarity search. 

## How to use it

You can use it either by providing : 
 - a direct link to **an image** on any web page (*preferably a JPEG link*); 
 - by clicking right (*using the contextual menu*) on any image on the web (*please note that images encapsulated into some code and not fully available publicly may not work*) or 
 - by using the **local file button** and by uploading in the underlying graphical user interface a local image from your own drive.
